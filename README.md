**HR Attrition Analysis with Power BI**
This project focuses on analyzing employee attrition within an organization using an HR dataset and visualizing insights through Power BI. The goal is to identify key factors influencing employee turnover, providing actionable insights that can help reduce attrition and improve retention strategies.

**Project Overview**
In this project, we work with a sample HR dataset containing employee information such as demographics, job roles, compensation, job satisfaction, and performance ratings. The dataset is used to build a Power BI dashboard that enables HR professionals and business stakeholders to visualize and understand attrition trends, pinpoint departments or job roles with high turnover, and uncover patterns related to employee satisfaction, tenure, and other factors.

**Technologies Used**
Power BI Desktop: For data transformation, visualizations, and dashboard creation.
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): For creating calculated columns and measures.
Power Query: For data cleansing and transformation tasks.
